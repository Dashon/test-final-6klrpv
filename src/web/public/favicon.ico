4. Technical Requirements:
- Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000
- Support for all modern browsers
- Optimized for both light and dark themes
- Proper scaling at all resolutions

5. Implementation Notes:
The favicon should be created using professional image editing software (like Adobe Photoshop or GIMP) and exported as an ICO file with the following steps:

1. Create the base image at 48x48 pixels
2. Include the platform's brand identity using #1A73E8 as primary color
3. Export multiple resolutions (48x48, 32x32, 16x16) into a single ICO file
4. Optimize the file size to be under 5KB
5. Test across all major browsers and display contexts

6. Server Configuration:
Add the following headers when serving the favicon:
```
Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000
ETag: true
Content-Type: image/x-icon
